If you\\'re feeling\\ncreative, and your favorite number hasn\\'t been taken already, you can\\nmake a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-\\nbase-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not\\nthat you won\\'t get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)\\n\\nOh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You\\'ll\\njust be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole\\nnet, and you\\'ll look like a clueless newbie too.\\n\\nBy now you\\'re probably asking \"So who\\'s the KotL already?\". Well, as\\nJohn Sloan notes below, that\\'s about the only real \"secret\" left around\\nhere, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,\\nnor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was\\nthe original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the\\nKotL\\'s first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely\\nwith hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-\\noriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting\\nmessages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with \"weenie\\nmailers\"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a\\nDead-Head.\\n\\n***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************\\n\\nOnce you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically\\ngroveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed\\nwork for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting\\nsomething done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)\\ndays, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of\\neconomic activity on the part of the KotL\\'s employers, sending yet\\nanother copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it\\njust makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an\\nexcersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least\\nannotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request\\nwas submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think\\nthe KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).\\n\\n***********************************************************************\\n\\nOne more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren\\'t what\\nthey used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?\\nThe typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &\\ne-mail address.

They discuss motorcycles and  \\nmotorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  \\nhelmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve\\nseats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, \\ntraffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double \\nentendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They \\nargue with each other and plan rides together.\\n\\nThe difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, \\nalthough they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each \\nother face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world \\nand communicate with each other electronically via computer.\\n\\nThe computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  \\nthe people range from college and university students to high-tech industry \\nprofessionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, \\nrec.motorcycles (pronounced \"wreck-dot-motorcycles,\" it\\'s the file name for \\nthe group\\'s primary on-line \"meeting place\") carries about 2250 articles per \\nmonth;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent \\nposters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred \\nto as the DoD.\\n\\nThe DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of \\nparodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer \\nenthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, \"Denizen \\nof Doom.\"  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of \\nthe Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of \\ncourse, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.\\n\\nThe idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules \\nappealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the \\nList, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been \\nalmost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and \\nCanada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, \\nGermany, Norway and Finland.\\n\\nKeeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run \\nof 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the \\nAmerican Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- \\nselling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a \\nfew months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were \\ndonated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 \\nto the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs \\nin the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.\\n\\nAs often as possible, the DoD\\'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go \\nriding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of \\nDoD\\'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California\\'s \\n\"Silicon Valley.\"  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on \\nRollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California \\n\"Joust.\"\\n\\nThe Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big \\nbarbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern \\nCalifornia ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, \\nmeeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan \\nfor 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction \\nwith the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.\\n\\nThough it\\'s a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective \\ncommunications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional \\nmotorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in \\nsearch of two-wheeled camaraderie, it\\'s a great way for kindred spirits to \\nget together.  Long may they flame.\\n\\n\\n\"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live\"\\t[centerbar]\\n\\nThis official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which \\nyou can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do \\nanything like that face to face.  These insults are known as \"flames\";  \\nissuing them is called \"flaming.\"  Flames often start when a member \\ndisagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A \\ntypical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be \\nsomething like:  \"What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad \\nposeur!\"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense \\nof the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding \\nability and your cat.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_\\n\\n                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011\\n\\nPeriodically the question \"What is DoD?\" is raised. This is one of\\nthose questions in the same class as \"Why is the sky blue?\", \"If there\\nis a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?\" and \"Why do\\nwomen inevitably tell you that you\\'re such a nice guy just before they\\ndump you?\", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,\\nand philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion\\nby philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the\\nhalls of academe for generations. \\n\\nA long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few\\nminutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on\\na computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two\\nmachines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another\\nvia a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but\\nwho was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of\\nthe various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and\\nsigned it \"The Denizen of Doom\". Not wishing to identify himself, he\\nasked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time\\nbecome DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit\\nabout what other people thought and generally being a right thinking\\nindividual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. \\n\\nHe who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was\\nthe funniest thing he\\'d seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty\\neasily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom\\nMotorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership\\nnumber. \\n\\nPerhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a\\nmotorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or\\nmake or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized\\nelectronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a\\npart of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a\\ngestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the\\nsum of its parts.  It could also be that we\\'re all computer nerds who\\nwear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen\\nto also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight\\nratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open\\nminded enough to accept us as members. \\n\\nIn a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom\\nMotorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have\\nnever met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet\\nfeel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some\\nof the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized\\nand run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the\\nnetwork via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list\\n(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the\\nsame region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating\\naround the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by\\n#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and\\ndistributed on VHS by #18)! \\n\\nWhere will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,\\nplacing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine\\nmanagement computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each\\nparticipant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?\\nWill the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal\\nroom and at least a 386-sized UNIX system?

I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer\\n     11 but what the heck.  \\n\\nStompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that\\'s all man.\\n\\nTerrible: Nahhhh, you\\'re sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at\\n     least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor!\\n     Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a\\n     Woosh-a-stream.\\n\\nStompin: You mean Wee-Stream.\\n\\nTerrible: Waddya going to do?

I love my BMW!\\n\\nTerrible: B.T.???\\n\\nArlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.\\n\\nMuck: Ahhh, look, you\\'re making Terrible gag.\\n\\nTerrible: What does BMW stand for anyway??? \\n\\nMuck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.\\n\\nTerrible: Actually, my name is Terrible.

I guess you had to be there. I\\nwasn\\'t.) \\n\\nChuck:  I didn\\'t want to be a Software Systems Analyst,\\n cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,\\n may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted\\n to live a man\\'s life,\\n[Music slowly builds in background]\\n riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes\\n and the deepest valleys,\\n living the life of a Motorcyclist;\\n doing donuts and evading the police;\\n terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;\\n eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).

And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.\\n\\nSometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: \"What does DoD\\nstand for? It\\'s not the Department of Defense is it?\" Naturally, a\\nDenizen who had watched the movie \"Top Gun\" a few times too many rose\\nto the occasion and replied:\\n\\n\"That\\'s classified, we could tell you, but then we\\'d have to kill you.\"\\n\\nAnd the rest is history.\\n\\nA variation on the \"security\" theme is to supply disinformation about\\nwhat DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where\\nknown) include:\\n\\nDaughters of Democracy (DoD 23)\\t\\tDoers of Donuts\\nDancers of Despair (DoD 9)\\t\\tDebasers of Daughters\\nDickweeds of Denver\\t\\t\\tDriveway of Death\\nDebauchers of Donuts\\t\\t\\tDumpers of Dirtbikes\\n\\nNote that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be\\nlimited only by the contents of one\\'s imagination or dictionary file.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                     The rec.moto.photo archive\\n\\nFirst a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck\\nRogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,\\nand several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in\\nunknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate\\nfor an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not\\nonly provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken\\nthe time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.\\n\\nNot only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk\\nat their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the\\nserver too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,\\nthe general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.\\n\\nHere are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how\\nto use the archive.\\n\\n**********************************************************\\n\\nVia ftp:\\n\\ncerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]\\n\\nVia e-mail:\\n\\nThe address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the\\nmessage.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The\\narguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For\\nrec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:\\n\\ndir [dod]\\nsend [dod]bruce_tanner.gif\\nsend [dod]dodframe.ps\\n\\nand you\\'ll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts\\nof bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.\\n\\nOh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to\\nthe next whole file) are send.  A \\'send [dod]*.gif\\' would send 150 files of\\n50K each; not a good idea.\\n-- \\nBruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDU\\nCerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner\\n\\n**********************************************************\\n\\nA couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so\\nwhy not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?\\nSecond, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind\\nof you to access it after normal working hours (California time). \\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                      Patches? What patches?\\n\\nYou may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &\\npins. And your reaction was probably: \"I want!\", or \"That\\'s sick!\", or\\nperhaps \"That\\'s sick! I want!\"\\n\\nWell, there\\'s some good news and some bad news. The good news is that\\nthere\\'s been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad\\nnews is that there isn\\'t anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn\\'t\\nbecause of any \"exclusivity\" attempt, but simply because there is no\\n\"DoD store\" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by\\nindividual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is\\nsomeone says \"I\\'m thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they\\'ll cost\\n$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?\" Then\\norders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the\\npre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a\\nDoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or\\nproduce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all\\nthis is anarchy in action.\\n\\nHere\\'s a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and\\nperpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),\\nmotorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts\\n(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and\\npatches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by\\npopular demand].\\n\\nAll \"profits\" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association\\nMotorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been\\ncontributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,\\nyou\\'ll see a large plaque on the Founders\\' Wall in the name of \"Denizens\\nof Doom, USENET, The World\", complete with a DoD pin.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHere\\'s a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.\\n\\n~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles\\n~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>\\n~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum\\n~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT\\n\\nI received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,\\nthe other day.\\n\\n\"Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:\\n\\nCongratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the\\nDenizens of Doom!

Rides:\\n\\nSummer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third\\nyear, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass\\ntrip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got\\ntogether for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north\\nas NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of\\nNorth Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great\\nPacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for\\nriding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have\\ncome to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]\\n\\nAlso worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the\\nMoab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,\\nriding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal\\n2-strokes.  And though it\\'s not an \"official\" (as if anything could be\\nofficial with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races\\nin Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters\\nto gather.  There\\'s also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah.\\nEuropean Denizens have staged some gathers too.

My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L.  For the\\nbottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the\\n46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, I have\\nlarge, muscular thighs, and no, I didn't use the thighmaster to get\\nthem :-).  The jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the\\nwaist, and too small in the arms.  I can't imagine finding a one-piece\\nsize that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's\\nproblems (strange, since my V-Pilot jacket fits great all over, and\\nwhen I tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).\\n\\nI can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are\\nin some way different from us real folks.\\n\\nAlso, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn\\nwierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands.\\nI've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a\\nstore wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom\\nin any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my\\nsidecar rig :-).  With the two piece, I unzip the pants (I generally\\nleave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall\\ndown unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight),\\nstuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags (the pants just fit),\\nand run errands just wearing the jacket.  Actually, if I know I'll be\\nrunning errands, I just wear my V-Pilot jacket, but that's just me...\\n\\nAs far as crash protection, I'd say that both suits are probably\\nequal.  It seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece\\nprovides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by\\n3 inches.  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around\\nthe waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.\\n\\nSo I'd have to vote for the two piece.

Do the gases really \\n>compress that much?\\n\\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\\n\\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\\nvacuum.\\n\\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\\ndifference and the products of combustion.\\n\\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\\n\\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\\n\\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n| Dave Tharp                      | DoD #0751   | \"You can\\'t wear out       |\\n| davet@interceptor.CDS.TEK.COM   | MRA #151    |   an Indian Scout,        |\\n| \\'88 K75S  \\'48 Indian Chief      | AHRMA #751  |  Or its brother the Chief.|\\n| \\'75 R90S(#151) \\'72 TR-2B(#751)  | AMA #524737 |  They\\'re built like rocks |\\n| \\'65 R50/2/Velorex  \\'57 NSU Max  |             |   to take the knocks,     |\\n|       1936 BMW R12              | (Compulsive | It\\'s the Harleys that     |\\n| My employer has no idea.        |   Joiner)   |   give you grief.\"        |\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

I took\\nthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was\\ndriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent\\nmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think\\nI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this\\nmoment is hazy.\\n\\nI next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The\\napologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut\\nmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my\\nshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.\\nSo I\\'m left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!\\n\\nInterestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never\\nmoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike\\noff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some\\ngut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me\\nhere, as I didn\\'t feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.\\n\\nWhat worries me about the accident is this: I don\\'t think I could have\\nprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not\\nnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was\\nriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if\\nit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the\\nthought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a\\nblind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are\\nlong enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?\\n\\nI eagerly await comment.\\n\\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\\nDoD# 0863      |I\\'d be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\\n\\n\\n * SLMR 2.1a * \"He\\'s hurt.\" \"Dammit Jim, I\\'m a Doctor -- oh, right.\"\\n                                                                                       \\n----\\n+===============================================================+\\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\\n+===============================================================+\\n',\n",

The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\\nFriz\\'s famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\\n\\n\\n      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)\\n                 Viking motor (front) ->   \\\\=@=/\\n\\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\\n\\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\\n\\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\\nengineering fixes was that until the engine\\'s oil pressure came up to\\nnormal, the engine\\'s valve timing would be more or less random,\\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\\n\\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\\n\\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\\nalmost perfect point:\\n\\n                    /\\\\\\n                   /()\\\\   <-lobe\\n                  / XX \\\\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to\\n valvestems ->   / \\\\  / \\\\    complexity)\\n                |  |   | |\\n                |  |===| |\\n                    =0=  <---piston\\n                     |\\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn\\'t show the\\n                             curvature because there was none in the\\n                             head itself. The bore curve would start\\n                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in\\n                             this diagram\\n\\n\\nThe effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of\\nthe day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of\\nfinned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, the\\nname.\\n\\nThe Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it\\nworked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary\\ntechnology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that\\nracing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machines\\nwere raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate\\n(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly two\\nSpringers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and\\ndown that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as\\ntwenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modern\\nrecord of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcycle\\nhistorians discount this story.\\n\\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\\nDoD# 0863      |I\\'d be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\\n\\n\\n * SLMR 2.1a * If you aren\\'t sliding, you aren\\'t riding.\\n                                                                                                          \\n----\\n+===============================================================+\\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\\n+===============================================================+\\n',\n",

Finally,\\nthe 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, \\nbecame warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I\\ntook a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.\\nThey had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours\\nbefore I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --\\nsurrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.\\n\\nToday was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,\\n50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat\\nTouring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.\\nSome sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one\\nMSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on\\nthe back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that\\nCycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like\\na big moto party.\\n\\nAfter about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,\\nand another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/\\npray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the\\nparking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from \\nthe Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else\\ninto the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the \\nST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of\\nthe road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a\\nbicycle!  \\'It cant be that heavy\\' I thought.\\n\\nWell I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could \\nthink was \"big\".  Then I put one foot up.  \"Heavy\" came to mind very\\nquickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to \\ntell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed\\nnearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.\\n\\nBy 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even\\non bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that \\ndid not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is\\non a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north\\nof the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95\\nsplits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access\\nhighway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, \\nManchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.\\nOn its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about\\n30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many\\nthoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.\\n\\nCindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along\\nin top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane \\nchanges were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this \\nthing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the\\nfairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was\\nnon-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.\\nSmooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,\\nbut it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless\\nbuzz.\\n\\nThe jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the\\nbrakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,\\ndecreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  \\nThe section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok\\nin this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack\\noft featured in \"Spencer for Hire\" -- a place where you could really \\nfind \"Spencer\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting\\nthrough traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.\\n\\nAbout half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy\\'s wrist, our singal\\nfor \"hold on tight\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second\\ngear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a \\nshort shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light\\ntraffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.\\nWell, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort\\nlane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went \\nuntil the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed\\nthere.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, \\nI looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.\\n\\nBeverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \"get\\noff in a mile\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted\\nto re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were\\nseveral manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the \\nslow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could \\nsee even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed\\nto thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad\\nout front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put\\nthe thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side\\nstand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.\\n\\n\\nMy demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,\\nhardly notices the DoD speed.   I\\'d buy on for about $3000 less than \\nlist, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.\\n-- \\n\\t Frank Evan Perdicaro \\t\\t\\t\\tXyvision Color Systems\\n      Legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.\\t\\t101 Edgewater Drive\\n   inhouse: frank@marvin, x5572\\t\\t\\t\\tWakefield MA\\nouthouse: frank@contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572\\t\\t018801285\\n',\n",

I then went out shopping for\\na new lock for the bicycle.\\n\\nFor about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock\\n(advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both,\\nKryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel).\\nI chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in\\ndisgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.\\n\\nFirst, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by\\nthe Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn\\'t even approach Kryptonite standards of\\nquality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable\\nlock with the Kryptonite name on it.\\n\\nSecondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I\\ndon\\'t know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often\\nquite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes\\nit would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.\\n\\nThirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves\\nthe sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the \\ndark.  I didn\\'t try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the \\nlock mechanism would stand up to an \"insert screwdriver and TORQUE\"\\nattack.\\n\\nFourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to \\ndeter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).

Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot\\nfaster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is\\nnot unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective\\nclothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong,\\nyou are likely to be less severely injured.\\n\\nFirst thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course,\\nthis will get you started on the right foot -- they teach\\ncontrol of the vehicle and safe riding practices.\\n\\nSecond, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet\\nand a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy \\npiece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking\\nboots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine\\nfor this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay \\ntied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps\\nare nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the\\npants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable,\\npreferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for\\na jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though\\nmore people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another\\nthing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand\\nleather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.\\n\\nThird don\\'t do anything stupid -- don\\'t ride after \\ndrinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement\\nand balance; don\\'t ride in the snow, or when conditions\\nare such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding\\nin the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly, \\nbrake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick,\\ntired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or\\notherwise not in average shape.\\n\\nWith care, you should be ok.\\n\\n>The next question I have is what bike would you recommend for\\n>a first time rider. I don\\'t want to race; nor do I want to\\n>ride cross country; nor do I want to ride on dirt trails. I\\'ll\\n>probably drive it on back roads with occasional rides on city\\n>streets and freeways. The maximum I can spend is about $2500 so\\n>I\\'ll be looking at a used bike.\\n\\nI would suggest mid to late 80\\'s japanese mid-sized standard.\\nSomething in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  If\\nyou are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as\\nlow as a 300-400 cc bike.\\n\\nPossible models: \\nThe Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally\\ninline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to \\nweakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier \\nproblems.)  My first bike was a (about \\'82) GS650, it server me well.\\n\\nThe Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series\\nI think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of\\nstandard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.\\n\\nKawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don\\'t know\\nthem as well.\\n\\nFor mid to late \\'80s models of the above, you should be able to\\nbuy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective \\nclothing and insurance and licensing costs.\\n\\nHope this helps,\\n-David\\n(dagibbs@qnx.com)\\n',\n",

       " \"From: edw@boi.hp.com (Edward Walsh)\\nSubject: Guzzi 850-T tires, plus fairing question\\nOrganization: Hewlett-Packard / Boise, Idaho\\nX-Newsreader: Tin 1.1 PL4\\nLines: 59\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\\n\\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\\ntube qualities?\\n\\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\\n\\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \\nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\\n\\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\\n\\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\\n\\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

Splitfires didn\\'t do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMC\\npickup (4.3l V6) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley\\nSportster 1200 and my best friend\\'s 1986 Sportster 883. Folks I know who\\'ve\\ntried them in 1340 Evo motors can\\'t tell any performance boost over plain\\nplugs (which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers\\nare pretty much the same shape, just different sizes). Two of my friends who\\nhave shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead,\\nI\\'d dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make\\nthe machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense (plus they look\\nreally cool with a spark plug on each side of each head)\\n-- \\n=============================================================================\\nNeal Howard   \\'91 XLH-1200      DoD #686      CompuTrac, Inc (Richardson, TX)\\n\\t      doh #0000001200   |355o33|      neal@cmptrc.lonestar.org\\n\\t      Std disclaimer: My opinions are mine, not CompuTrac\\'s.\\n         \"Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps\\n          we shall learn the truth.\" -- August Kekule\\' (1890)\\n=============================================================================\\n',\n",

I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage. \\nMy bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such\\nthat they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on the\\nlower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a \"bank-follower\", or a\\nlittle stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a\\n100%-banked turn.  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7\\nmm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for the\\nmystery.\\n\\nThe stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I\\'m\\nfairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end of\\nthe footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread in\\nthe hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of something\\nhaving been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.  \\n\\nOkay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ?  How can you\\nrip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) without\\ndamaging the thread in the hole ?  Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo\\nthat Kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenly\\nchanges phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid\\n?

The point of formal training \\nmust be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinion\\nto know as much as possible.

A common reaction among \\nnew bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the \\nmotorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the\\ndirection opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous.\\nI have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/she\\nis to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the \\nmotorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right \\nhandle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road. \\nA worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn\\nthe rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider tries\\nto steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.\\n\\nThe main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency \\nsituations, AND what to do if in one.

Kinda Offical...\\nSummary: Supposed \"Higher power output\".\\nDistribution: rec.motorcycles\\nKeywords: Using Splitfire plugs for performance.\\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana\\nLines: 54\\n\\n\\nYo, Whaz up!!!\\n\\nEarlier, I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs.  One\\nguy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well,\\nI saw one think that someone said about \"Show me a team that used Split-\\nfires....\"  Well, here\\'s some additional insight and some theories\\nabout splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.\\n\\nSplitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and\\nincreased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires\\nincreased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren\\'t focusing\\non horsepower numbers.\\n\\nNow how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that\\ndepends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?\\nIn the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,\\nbut 4\\'s make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.\\nSo for 4\\'s, splitfires would not significantly increase power.\\n\\nBut what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,\\nbut many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for\\nthe hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,\\ntwins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this\\ntranslate?  Increased torque should \"theoretically\" help twins make\\nmore power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods\\nor anything made, just stick \\'em in.\\n\\nNow I don\\'t know about all of this (and I\\'m trying to catch up with\\nsomebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than\\n4\\'s.        \\n\\nAs far as racing teams....  Ducati team \"Fast by Ferraci\" used\\nsplitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James\\nrunning for em), but I don\\'t know why they stopped since then.\\nAlso, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....\\n\\nPeace.\\n\\nWarren\\nwcd82671@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\\n\"Have Suzuki, will travel...\"\\n\\nAt a local \"fix-er-up-er\" shop, the bike repairest looked at a\\ndumped ZX-7.  Then he asked the guy...\\n\\n\"What happened...\"   \"I dumped the clutch...\"\\n\"How fast...\"        \"Pretty fast...\"\\n\"Insurance...\"       \"Nope.\"\\n\\nThe fixer smiled.....\\n\\n\"What do you know about bikes?\"   \"Not much.....\"\\n \\n',\n",

If it's a choice\\nbetween injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is\\nonly one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put\\nthe dog first.\\n\\nSecond, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react\\nto a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're\\nplaying with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which\\nhas hostile intent.\\n\\nThird, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social\\nbeasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are\\ntwo types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which\\ndominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the\\nlatter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.\\nBut God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may\\neven on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh\\nrapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!\\n\\nNow, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to\\nassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a\\ngame, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;\\nwhen you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of\\ninterception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so\\nthat when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to\\nreact to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a\\nmotorcycle is capable of.\\n\\nWith a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures\\nmay be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important\\n-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the\\nroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up\\nnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will\\nhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is\\nthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The\\nlarger the dog, the greater your anger.\\n\\nDogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he\\nare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he\\nis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.\\n\\nMost dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory\\nwhere there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are\\nsatisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped\\npunishment.\\n\\nThe interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great\\ndeal to them.  The more effective you are at communicating body language, the\\nless you actually have to do.  After 7 years with my 93 pound beast, I've\\nlearned a few tricks I think...\\n\",\n",

Hence, any apparent\\n>similarity in handling characteristics may, or may *not* be analagous\\n>in its underlying physics to that behind motorcycle handling\\n>characteristics.\\n\\nOK, as one last attempt, I\\'ll take a different tack.\\n\\nWe all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why\\none can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,\\nis one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to\\ndesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and\\nsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of\\nus who have bikes are familiar.\\n\\nLet\\'s look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its\\nown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to\\nget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches\\nto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to\\nremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,\\nthrough suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the\\nsame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along \\na dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change \\nsurfaces to something that won\\'t transmit forces through the contact \\npatches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It \\nprobably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, \\nbut we wouldn\\'t get a good idea of how well or what it feels like \\nbecause, without the contact patches, we can\\'t turn.  Maybe there\\'s a \\nbetter way. Besides, even ice doesn\\'t get rid of the contact patch\\nforces altogether, so we\\'d have to find a really frictionless surface.\\nYou\\'d have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\\nwas the rotation that did it.\\n\\nLooking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.\\nNow we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and\\ndirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them\\nabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\\nHow it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we\\'re just looking\\nfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\\nsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don\\'t know of any snow-ski\\nor skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\\nlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\\nI think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\\nthat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\\nNow I admit that this is second hand info (although I\\'d love to try\\none of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in\\na bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\\nmuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\\nSo we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike\\'s,\\na similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\\ncountersteering.\\n\\nConclusion: you don\\'t need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have\\nmotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don\\'t know what\\nreal effect the gyroscopes have when they\\'re there, but from my observations\\nof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I\\'m \\nwilling to bet that they\\'re not the dominant factor in countersteering. \\n\\nIf you don\\'t like this conclusion, then don\\'t accept it, but my motorcycle\\'s\\nbehaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.\\n\\nI\\'ve        bike                      like       | Jody Levine  DoD #275 kV\\n     got a       you can        if you      -PF  | Jody.P.Levine@hydro.on.ca\\n                         ride it                 | Toronto, Ontario, Canada\\n',\n",

I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from \\nDennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my \\'85 FJ1100. They are rated\\nat 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to\\nthe relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay\\npins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used\\na crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.\\n\\tI installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front\\nfairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube\\nframe used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to\\ndo this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two\\nvertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing\\nfollows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.\\nThe compressor is about 2\" in diameter and about 5\" long.\\n\\tThe relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small\\nso there should be plenty of good places for it.\\n\\tI found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to\\nmount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side\\njust in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the\\nhorns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where\\nthe gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough\\nroom to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice\\ncut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.\\n\\tThe short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out\\nabout an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look\\nclosely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight\\nahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).\\n\\tIf you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try\\nto explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them\\nfirst.\\n\\tHow do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound\\nmore like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.\\nI have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has\\nnot blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).\\n\\tI\\'ve repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though\\nthey know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping\\nthe pedestrians on the sidewalk.\\nThe bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to\\nthose stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)\\nand are relatively easy to install on the FJ.

Some people catch on immediately\\nand lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning\\nthing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a\\npain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay\\nperpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn\\nand WHIP AROUND until they\\'re in the `correct\\' position.  This always\\nscrews up the line I\\'ve picked out.\\n\\nHere\\'s my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:\\n\\t- attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.\\n\\t- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not\\n\\t  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I\\'ve had people try to dismount\\n\\t  in traffic, just as I\\'m pulling in to a parking space!)\\n\\t- Muffler gets HOT! (\\'Nuff said)\\n\\t- We get *GOOD* traction.  We\\'re not going to fall over.  (Many\\n\\t  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)\\n\\t- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you\\'re sitting upright and\\n\\t  we\\'re going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you\\'re\\n\\t  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel\\n\\t  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  \\n\\t- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be \\n\\t  gradual, so I can compensate.\\n\\t- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.\\n\\t- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right \\n\\t  thing -- I\\'ve driven many miles on this thing, and know how\\n\\t  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to\\n\\t  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to \\n\\t  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, \\n\\t  and whever we topped 35 mph, she\\'d holler, \"SLOW DOWN! I\\'M SCARED\" \\n\\t  I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with \\n\\t  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.\\n\\t  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the\\n\\t  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her\\n\\t  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to \\n\\t  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)\\n\\nUsually I\\'ll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, \\ntires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.\\nHelps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.\\n\\nWatch out for gravel on the Mt.

I don't\\n>have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\\n>\\n>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?\\n\\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\\n\\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\\n\\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\\nI also passed my road test.\\n\\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\\na car and been killed.\\n\\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\\nas I did.\\n\\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\\nyou're ready to use it.\\n\\n>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \\n>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \\n>ignorant to know I need to buy)\\n\\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\\n\\n>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \\n>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\\n>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \\n>motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\\n>a difference)\\n\\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\\nmore expensive.\\n\\n>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\\n\\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\\n\\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\\n\\n-- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)\\n-- '80 BMW R65   DoD #0969   also BMWMOA, NRA, ACLU, et al.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

This is a pretty broad \\n interest group. Individuals have a variety of backgrounds: motojournalism, \\n roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers, engineering,\\n motosports enthusiasts.\\n\\n The size of the list grows weekly. We are currently at a little\\n over one hundred and eighty-five members, with contributors from\\n New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, England, Canada\\n Finland, Switzerland, and the United States.\\n\\n The list was formed (October 1991) in response to a perceived need \\n to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of \\n performance (roadracing) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise \\n ratio found in rec.motorcycles. Anyone is free to join.\\n\\n Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to \\n issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be \"flame-free\".  \\n\\n HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION\\n ---------------------------------\\n\\n You are welcome to subscribe. To subscribe send your request to:\\n\\n\\n        race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\\n\\n\\n Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day\\n (depending on the topic). \\n\\n   NB: Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the\\n       list directly.\\n \\n After you have contacted the list administrator, you will receive\\n an RSVP request. Please respond to this request in a timely manner\\n so that you can be added to the list. The request is generated in\\n order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site.\\n \\n Upon receipt of your RSVP, you will be added to either the daily\\n or digest distribution (as per your initial request).\\n\\n HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION\\n ----------------------------------\\n\\n It is possible to receive the list in \\'digest\\'ed form (ie. a\\n single email message). The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out \\n whenever it contains enough interesting content. Given the\\n frequency of postings this appears to be about every other\\n day.\\n\\n Should you wish to receive the list via digest (once every \\n 30-40K or so), please send a subscription request to:\\n\\n\\n        digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\\n\\n\\n HOW TO POST TO THE LIST\\n -----------------------\\n\\n This is an open forum. To post an article to the list, send to:\\n\\n\\n        race@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM\\n\\n\\n Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may\\n not see the mail that you have posted. If you want to see it\\n (though this isn\\'t necessarily a guarantee that it went out)\\n you can include a \"metoo\" line in your .mailrc file (on UNIX\\n based mail systems). \\n\\n BOUNCES\\n -------\\n\\n Because I haven\\'t had the time (or the inclination to replace\\n the list distribution mechanism) we still have a problem with\\n bounces returning to the poster of a message. Occasionally,\\n sites or users go off-line (either leaving their place of\\n employment prematurely or hardware problems) and you will receive\\n bounces from the race list. Check the headers carefully, and\\n if you find that the bounce originated at Sun (from whence I\\n administer this list) contact me through my administration\\n hat (race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com).

It *may*\\nbe possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is,\\nthrough trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology.\\nOnly by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one\\nimprove on that technique (I hold that this applies to any human\\nendeavor).\\n\\n>that\\'s all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that\\n>it is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster\\n>or better as a result, is absurd.\\n\\nDo you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd?\\nAre you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management\\npolicy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or\\ndecrease available traction?
